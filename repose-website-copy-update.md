# Repose Website Copy Update

## Overview

This document contains updated copy for the Repose landing page. The goal is to improve clarity (making it obvious this is an audio app), reduce redundancy, and improve section sequencing.

**Important:** Only update the text content. Do not modify any HTML structure, CSS styling, class names, or JavaScript functionality.

## Section-by-Section Changes

### 1. Hero Subtitle

**Find:**
> Neuroscience-backed frequencies quiet your mind and open you to change. Pair with affirmations that actually land, whether releasing old doubts or inviting something new.

**Replace with:**
> Listen to layered audio frequencies that quiet your mind and open you to change. Pair with affirmations that actually land, whether releasing old doubts or inviting something new.

---

### 2. Move "The Approach" Section

**Action:** Move "The Approach" section to appear immediately after the hero section (after the first TestFlight CTA buttons), before "How Repose Works."

**Updated copy for The Approach:**
> Instead of willpower, Repose works with your brain's natural plasticity. The audio opens receptivity, affirmations seed new patterns, and rest lets them take hold. Change becomes easier when you stop forcing it.

---

### 3. How Repose Works - Step 1

**Find:**
> Choose a purpose—falling asleep, waking up, a midday reset, or deep meditation. Each one sequences brainwave states differently based on what you need.

**Replace with:**

### 4. How Repose Works - Step 2

**Find:**
> Pick a nature soundscape. Add affirmations from our library, type your own and hear them spoken back to you, record your own voice, or upload audio you already have.

**Replace with:**
> Pick a nature soundscape to play throughout. Add spoken affirmations from our library, type your own and hear them read back, or record them in your own voice.

---

### 5. How Repose Works - Step 3

**Find:**
> The session guides your brain through targeted states. Works as you fall asleep, wake up, take a midday break, or settle into longer meditation.

**Replace with:**
> Put on headphones and listen. The audio guides your brain through targeted states while you rest.

### 6. Rename "What Makes Repose Different" to "Why It Works"

**Action:** Change the section heading from "What Makes Repose Different" to "Why It Works"

---

### 7. Gamma Entrainment for Neuroplasticity

**Find:**
> This isn't ambient noise. Repose uses layered frequencies to move your brain in and out of gamma states, the same brainwave pattern linked to heightened learning and neural flexibility. Your mind becomes more receptive to change.

**Replace with:**
> This isn't ambient noise. Repose plays layered audio frequencies that move your brain in and out of gamma states, the brainwave pattern linked to heightened learning and neural flexibility.

---

### 8. Affirmations That Land

**Find:**
> Affirmations work better when your brain is primed for them. Repose delivers them at the right moment, in the right state. Choose from a list, write your own, or record them in your own voice for deeper resonance.

**Replace with:**
> Affirmations work better when your brain is primed for them. Repose plays them at the right moment, in the right state.

### 9. Delete "Fits Your Day" Section

**Action:** Remove the entire "Fits Your Day" section (heading and body text). This content is redundant with other sections.

---

### 10. Release and Receive

**Find:**
> Self-doubt, limiting beliefs, mental loops that won't quit. Gamma entrainment creates space for these patterns to soften and release. The same receptivity that lets go of what's stuck can welcome what you're ready to grow toward: confidence, connection, abundance, peace.

**Replace with:**
> We all carry doubts and beliefs that hold us back. Listening in a gamma state creates space for those patterns to soften, and that same openness can welcome something new.

---

### 11. Move "The Research" Section to End

**Action:** Move "The Research" section to appear after the "Ready to Begin?" CTA section, just before the footer. Research should be the last content section on the page.
