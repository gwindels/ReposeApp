## Hero

**Real Hypnosis. Just Your Phone.**

Repose uses your phone's sensors to guide you into a real hypnotic state, adapting to your breathing and heartbeat in real time. Or build your own brainwave session with affirmations timed to land when your mind is most open. No watch. No headband. No effort.

## The Approach

**Stop Trying. Start Changing.**

Most meditation asks you to concentrate. Repose asks you to stop. The audio uses brainwave entrainment, layered tones that gently shift your brain's electrical activity from alert waking states into deeper, more receptive ones. Affirmations play during a brief gamma state, a fast brainwave rhythm linked to heightened learning and neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to form new neural pathways). You don't focus. You don't follow along. You press play and let go.

## How Repose Works

**Two Ways In**

### Deep Hypnosis

Place your phone on your chest, put on headphones, and close your eyes. The app senses your breathing and heartbeat through motion, no watch, no headband, nothing to buy. Over 33 minutes, it guides you through seven phases of hypnosis, pacing itself to your body. Your affirmations play at the deepest point, when your brain is most open to receiving them. Don't want the phone on your chest? Switch to Listening Mode for the same session on a gentle timer.

### Custom Sessions

Choose what you need: falling asleep, waking up, a midday reset, or deep meditation. Each session moves your brain through a specific sequence of brainwave states such as alpha (calm, relaxed awareness), theta (deep rest, dreamlike), and gamma (heightened learning), matched to your session's purpose. Add a soundscape like rain, ocean, wind, or an open field. Then add affirmations from the library, type your own and hear them spoken back, or record them in your voice. Press play. The audio does the rest.

## Why It Works

### Your Phone Reads Your Body

During Deep Hypnosis, your phone's motion sensor tracks your breathing rhythm, detects your heartbeat, and notices when you've settled into stillness. The session responds in real time: it waits for your exhale, deepens when you're still, and delivers affirmations when your body is ready. No extra device needed.

### Brainwave Entrainment, Not Background Noise

Each session plays binaural beats, layered audio tones that create a subtle pulsing frequency your brain naturally follows. This effect, called brainwave entrainment, is a well-studied phenomenon in which external rhythmic stimulation shifts the brain's own electrical rhythms. Sessions move you through targeted states in a deliberate order: sleep sessions descend into slow delta waves for deep rest, morning sessions build toward fast beta waves for alertness, and every session passes through gamma, the 40 Hz brainwave pattern most strongly linked to neuroplasticity and learning.

### Affirmations When They Count

Most apps play affirmations over calm music and hope for the best. Repose delivers them specifically during the gamma phase of your session, a brief window when research suggests your brain is most receptive to forming new patterns. That's the difference between hearing words and absorbing them.

### Make Them Yours

Choose from 21 professionally voiced affirmations across three themes: peace, sleep, and abundance. Or type anything and hear it spoken back in a natural voice. Or record it yourself. Or upload audio you already have. Mix them however you want in a single session.

## Private by Design

**No account. No sign-up.** Download and start immediately.

**Nothing leaves your phone.** Your sessions, affirmations, and recordings stay on your device. There's no cloud and no server.

**No tracking.** Repose doesn't log what you do, when you use it, or how often. It's a personal tool, not a platform.

## The Research

Repose is built on principles from peer-reviewed neuroscience: brainwave entrainment, gamma-frequency stimulation, and the relationship between brainwave states and suggestibility. Here are some starting points if you'd like to go deeper.

- **Gamma frequency entrainment attenuates amyloid load and modifies microglia**
  Iaccarino et al., Nature (2016). The landmark MIT study that launched the field of gamma sensory stimulation research, showing that 40 Hz light flickering reduced Alzheimer's-related proteins in mice.

- **Multisensory gamma stimulation promotes glymphatic clearance of amyloid**
  Murdock et al., Nature (2024). Found that combined 40 Hz audio and visual stimulation increased the brain's waste-clearing glymphatic system activity through neuropeptide signaling.

- **Evidence that 40 Hz gamma stimulation promotes brain health is expanding**
  Park & Tsai, PLOS Biology (2025). MIT's comprehensive review of a decade of gamma entrainment research from labs worldwide, covering mechanisms, cellular responses, and emerging human clinical evidence.

- **40 Hz sensory stimulation may benefit some Alzheimer's patients for years**
  Chan et al., Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). The longest-term human study of daily 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation (two years), showing safety and potential cognitive benefits in late-onset Alzheimer's patients.

- **A parametric investigation of binaural beats for brain entrainment and enhancing sustained attention**
  Melnichuk et al., Scientific Reports (2025). A rigorous EEG-validated study systematically varying binaural beat parameters to measure entrainment and attentional effects.

- **Brain oscillations, hypnosis, and hypnotizability**
  Jensen et al., International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis (2015). A foundational paper on how theta and gamma brainwave oscillations relate to hypnotic responding, proposing mechanistic models for how brainwave states facilitate suggestibility.

- **Advancing personalized digital therapeutics: integrating music therapy, brainwave entrainment, and AI-driven biofeedback**
  Jang et al., Frontiers in Psychology (2025). A comprehensive review proposing frameworks for combining brainwave entrainment, adaptive biofeedback, and personalized audio.

- **Smartphone inertial sensors can accurately measure instantaneous heart and breathing rates**
  Cinotti et al., Sensors (2025). Validates the use of smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes for simultaneous real-time detection of heartbeat and breathing, the same sensor approach used in Repose's Deep Hypnosis mode.

Repose is a wellness tool, not a medical device. It does not diagnose, treat, or cure any condition.
