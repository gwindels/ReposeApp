## Hero

**Change Without Effort**

Neuroscience-backed frequencies quiet your mind and open you to change. Pair with affirmations that actually land, whether releasing old doubts or inviting something new.

## How Repose Works

**1. Create Your Session**

Choose a purpose—falling asleep, waking up, a midday reset, or deep meditation. Each one sequences brainwave states differently based on what you need.

**2. Make It Yours**

Pick a nature soundscape. Add affirmations from our library, type your own and hear them spoken back to you, record your own voice, or upload audio you already have.

**3. Press Play and Let Go**

The session guides your brain through targeted states. Works as you fall asleep, wake up, take a midday break, or settle into longer meditation.

## What Makes Repose Different

**Gamma Entrainment for Neuroplasticity**

This isn't ambient noise. Repose uses layered frequencies to move your brain in and out of gamma states, the same brainwave pattern linked to heightened learning and neural flexibility. Your mind becomes more receptive to change.

**Affirmations That Land**

Affirmations work better when your brain is primed for them. Repose delivers them at the right moment, in the right state. Choose from a list, write your own, or record them in your own voice for deeper resonance.

**Fits Your Day**

Use Repose when you wake up to prime your mind for the day. Reset during a break. Go deeper in a longer meditation session. Or use it as you fall asleep, when your brain is especially open to rewiring. Brainwave states are sequenced based on what that moment needs.

**Release and Receive**

Self-doubt, limiting beliefs, mental loops that won't quit. Gamma entrainment creates space for these patterns to soften and release. The same receptivity that lets go of what's stuck can welcome what you're ready to grow toward: confidence, connection, abundance, peace.

## The Approach

Instead of willpower, Repose uses your brain's natural plasticity. Gamma entrainment opens receptivity, affirmations seed new patterns, rest lets them take hold. Change is easier when you stop forcing it.

## The Research

Repose is built on peer-reviewed neuroscience. Here are a few starting points if you'd like to go deeper.

- [Gamma frequency entrainment attenuates amyloid load and modifies microglia](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20587) — The 2016 Nature paper from MIT that launched the field of gamma sensory stimulation research.

- [Evidence that 40Hz gamma stimulation promotes brain health is expanding](https://news.mit.edu/2025/evidence-40hz-gamma-stimulation-promotes-brain-health-expanding-0314) — MIT's 2025 review of a decade of research from labs worldwide on gamma entrainment benefits.

- [Binaural beats to entrain the brain? A systematic review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10198548/) — A comprehensive review of studies on binaural beat stimulation and brainwave entrainment.

- [Multisensory gamma stimulation promotes glymphatic clearance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07132-6) — 2024 Nature paper showing how 40Hz stimulation supports the brain's waste-clearing system.
