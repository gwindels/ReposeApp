# Privacy Policy for Repose App

**Last Updated: January 26, 2026**

## Overview

Repose ("the App") is developed by Christopher Bruce Gary Hagie Windels ("I", "me"). I respect your privacy and designed this app to operate without collecting your personal data.

## Data Collection

**I do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** The App has no user accounts, no analytics, and no tracking.

## Microphone Access

The App requests microphone access to let you record voice affirmations. These recordings are stored locally on your device and never leave your phone.

## Text-to-Speech

If you use the text-to-speech feature, the text you enter is sent to OpenAI to generate an audio file. Once generated, the audio is stored only on your device. I do not have access to this data. OpenAI's privacy policy applies to this processing: [https://openai.com/privacy](https://openai.com/privacy)

## Data Storage

All app data—including your sessions, recordings, and preferences—is stored locally on your device. Nothing is transmitted to external servers except as described above for text-to-speech.

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service used is OpenAI for text-to-speech generation. No analytics, advertising, or tracking services are integrated into the App.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be reflected with a new "Last Updated" date.
